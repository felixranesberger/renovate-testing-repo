| Internal linking is a vital part of your website, not only is this important for your visitors but also for SEO.
| It creates relations between pages and determines what pages are important.
|
| The premium extension generates internal linking suggestions for you, based on the current site you're working on.
| These are calculated with an internal search engine which searches for the most related pages,
  based on the prominent words and cornerstone content.
|
| Below each text editor of (standard) content elements you can find a list of suggestions.
| Behind each suggestion is a status column to let you know if you already have a link to that page.
