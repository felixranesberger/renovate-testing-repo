What does it do?
================

The Localization Manager (l10nmgr) is a localization management extension for TYPO3 supporting a variety of
online and offline translation workflows.

Online translation
------------------

Online translation in the TYPO3 backend can be done in a two column view with additional information on changes
in the source text.

Offline translation
-------------------

For offline translation workflows the l10nmgr allows for export of translatable content into XML and MS Excel format.
The exported XML files have a localization-friendly format and can be translated with any state of the art translation
tool such as  across, DéjàVu, MemoQ, SDL TRADOS TagEditor and SDL PASSOLO. Configuration files for major translation
tools are provided and can be downloaded in the backend. MS Excel files can be translated in OpenOffice Calc or
Microsoft Excel. After translation the target files can be reimported into TYPO3. All translation data is stored automatically in the
right place – no manual copying anymore.

Automation
----------

Exports for different parts of the website and for multiple target languages at the same time can be automated and
exported files can be uploaded automatically to the FTP server of a language service provider or send by email.
Translated XML files (XML or ZIP) can be automatically imported into TYPO3 by an import service.
