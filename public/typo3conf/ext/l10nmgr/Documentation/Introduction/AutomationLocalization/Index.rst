Support and automation of the localization process
==================================================

Given this situation, the main idea behind developing Localization Manager was to realize a tool that supports and
automates the localization process in order to make it more userfriendly. The user managing the website localization
(e.g. administrator or project manager) should be able to export the localizable data so that it can be sent or assigned
to translators. After translators have finished their work (using their CAT tools), translations can be sent back to the
responsible person, who re-imports then the files into TYPO3. On import, all data in localized pages and content elements
and the relations between them are automatically inserted into the database.
