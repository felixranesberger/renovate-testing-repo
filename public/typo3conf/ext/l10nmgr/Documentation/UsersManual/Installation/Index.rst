Download the extension from the TYPO3 extension repository or from forge.typo3.org. Then install it with the extension
manager. If you already use an older version of l10nmgr, make a backup of the extension directory. In case something
fails, you'll have the possibility of re-establishing the original installation state from where you started the update.
Please note that you first need to install the extension :code:`static_info_tables`.
