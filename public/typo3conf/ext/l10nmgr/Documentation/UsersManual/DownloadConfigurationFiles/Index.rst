Localization Manager comes with predefined configuration files for Across, DÃ©jÃ Vu, memoQ, SDL TRADOS TagEditor,
SDL Trados Studio and SDL PASSOLO. Configuration files or settings files contain information about the localization
format, e.g. which tags are internal or external, which tags or attributes are translatable or not, etc. With this
information translation tools are able to extract only translatable information from the file and protect
non-translatable information from being touched. Download the configuration files and send them to the translator or
translation service provider together with the XML.

To download the configuration files, proceed as follows:

1. Go to Web>Localization Manager in the backend.
2. Select a localization configuration from the table and click on the name of the configuration. This opens the Localization Manager and loads settings from the configuration.
3. Select the target language for your export from the drop-down list.
4. Select XML Export/Import from the drop-down list and click on the Settings tab.
5. Download the configuration file for your translation tool with a right-click on the desired configuration > Save target as
