Install the extension `static_info_tables` to display the correct ISO language codes.
Precondition is a proper multi-language setup of TYPO3 and correct UTF8 environment is suggested.
The key concept of the extension is that you need to set up the required “L10N Configuration” Records. These records
define what content should be included for the translation work. (See section Creating a Localization Manager
